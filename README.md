WeatherVU is a personal project, a basic weather app designed in 2 hours in HTML, CSS and JS.

### How does it work?

WeatherVU is designed in HTML, CSS and JS. The page layout and style are contained in their respective HTML and CSS files. The page tries to get the user's geolocation data through their browser. If the user denies, it will use the fallback option that fetches the user's IP through the ipdata.co API. Then, using the open-meteo.com API, it gets the current temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. The app is fairly basic but i wanted to challenge myself to finish a weather app using API's as fast as possible.

### Where can i access it?
